# CS207fall2020 PROJECT

This project is a lcd and laptop controlled drawing robot. It was built due to my interest in integrating art into computer science and this serves as a way to do so. The original project was devloped by DIY Machines on Youtube.com [1] although with the addition of the lcd controller as a modification. An Sd card modification can also be made to the project making it fully usable wthout a laptop connected. This i plan to do in the nearest future.
